# Quantitative-Paleontology-for-Mathematica
This Mathematica add-in performs quantitative analyses and modeling common in the field of paleontology, including simulating diversity through time, cohort/survivorship analysis, disparity through time, principal coordinates analysis, and various GIS functions.

<b>Installation:</b> The file is a ".m" file, which can be imported into Mathematica 6.0 and later (functions do not work in earlier versions of Mathematica). Install using the "Install" item on the "File" menu. Once installed, you must load the package like any other with the line <<PollyQuantPaleo, using either this suggested name or another. 

<b>Changes in 5.x.</b> Added functions for Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) and Gower distances. Fixed bugs in Disparity[] and DisparityWithStages[] and added new character-based distance metric.

Funding for development for this package has been provided by grants NSF EAR 1338298, the Robert R. Shrock fund at Indiana University, the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies, and the Lilly Endowment through its support for the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute and the Indiana METACyt Initiative. This package was developed for the Indiana University course EAS G563, Quantitative Paleontology.
